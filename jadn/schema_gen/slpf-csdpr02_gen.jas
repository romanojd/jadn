Target ::= CHOICE {    -- SLPF targets
    rule_number  [1] Rule-ID     -- Uniquely identifies a rule associated with a previously-issued deny or allow.
}

Args ::= MAP {    -- SLPF command arguments
    drop_process  [1] Drop-Process OPTIONAL,    -- Specifies how to handle denied packets
    running       [2] BOOLEAN OPTIONAL,    -- Normal operation assumes updates are persistent. If TRUE, updates are not persistent in the event of a reboot or restart.  Default=FALSE.
    direction     [3] Direction OPTIONAL,    -- Specifies whether to apply rules to incoming or outgoing traffic. If omitted, rules are applied to both.
    insert_rule   [4] Rule-ID OPTIONAL     -- Specifies the identifier of the rule within a list, typically used in a top-down rule list.
}

Drop-Process ::= ENUMERATED {
    none         (1),    -- Drop the packet and do not send a notification to the source of the packet.
    reject       (2),    -- Drop the packet and send an ICMP host unreachable (or equivalent) to the source of the packet.
    false_ack    (3)     -- Drop the traffic and send a false acknowledgement that the data was received by the destination.
}

Direction ::= ENUMERATED {
    ingress      (1),    -- Apply rules to incoming traffic only
    egress       (2)     -- Apply rule to outbound traffic only
}

Rule-ID ::= INTEGER    -- Immutable identifier assigned when an access rule is created.

Specifiers ::= MAP {    -- SLPF actuator specifiers
    hostname     [1] STRING OPTIONAL,    -- RFC 1123 hostname (can be a domain name or IP address) for a particular device with SLPF functionality
    named_group  [2] STRING OPTIONAL,    -- User-defined collection of devices with SLPF functionality
    asset_id     [3] STRING OPTIONAL,    -- Unique identifier for a particular SLPF
    asset_tuple  [4] STRING OPTIONAL     -- Unique tuple identifier for a particular SLPF consisting of a list of up to 10 strings %{'max': 10}
}

Results ::= MAP {    -- SLPF results
    rule_number  [1] Rule-ID OPTIONAL     -- Rule identifier returned from allow or deny command.
}
